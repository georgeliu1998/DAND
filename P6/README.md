# Flight Delay Data Visualization

This visualization provides a quick overview of United States air carriers' flight delay situation. 
It highlights the percentages of delays and average delay time across different carriers. 
The visualization is based on RITA's 2008 flight delays data (the data is first transformed and summarized using R). 
UniqueCarrier (carrier name) and ArrDelay (arrival delay time in minutes) are the two variables that are examined for insights 
in this project.
