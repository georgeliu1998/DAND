# Understanding Wine Quality through the Lens of Data Analysis Using R

We have always relied on wine experts who use their esoteric jargon to rate wine qualities for us. 
But what exactly is wine quality based on? What are the criteria? In this project, 
we look at the Wine Quality dataset and use data analysis methods with R to explore the relationship between wine quality 
and various attributes such as acidity, sugar and alcohol.

# Requirements
