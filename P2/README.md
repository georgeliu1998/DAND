# Investigate Titanic Dataset

RMS Titanic's sinking was one of the worst maritime disasters in modern history. With the dataset obtained from Kaggle, 
we can now garner some insights about the passengers on board the ship. In this project, we will examine the Titanic dataset and 
try to answer the following questions: Were all passengers on board equally likely to survive? If not, what were some characteristics 
for people who survived compared with people who didn't?

## Requirements

of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Also, the following packages are needed:
