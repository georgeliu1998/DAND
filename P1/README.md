# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon - Stroop Effect

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink.
The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. 

The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words
condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed:
for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose
names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we
measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and
record a time from each condition.
