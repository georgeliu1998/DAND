# Identify Fraud from Enron Dataset

Once a gigantic corporation claiming to have revenues of 111 billion dollars, Enron’s share price decreased from 90 dollars to just 
pennies in mid-2000 before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The Enron Scandal was a result of “creative accounting” and corporate fraud, 
and this fraud was linked to a small number of employees out of Enron’s 20,000 staff. Given data, is it possible to detect fraud and 
identify “person of interest” for investigation? In this project, we will use the publicly available Enron dataset that contains 
financial and email data of 146 people to identify fraud using machine learning techniques.
